$ d2 layout tala

tala (executable plugin at /opt/homebrew/bin/d2plugin-tala):

https://terrastruct.com/tala.
TALA is a proprietary layout engine designed for software architecture diagrams.

TALA is free to try and evaluate, but requires an API token from a Terrastruct account to use without watermark.

You can set the API token as environment variable $TSTRUCT_TOKEN, or in ~/.config/tstruct/auth.json under the field "api_token".

You can use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $TSTRUCT_AUTHFILE to control the location of the authfile.

The advantage to using ~/.config/tstruct/auth.json over $TSTRUCT_TOKEN is that the
TALA plugin will automatically update the api_token stored in the authfile as your
subscription renews.

It does this by making a ping to Terrastruct's servers when your subscription
is set to renew. For example, if you purchased a monthly subscription on
January 1, the TALA plugin will make a ping to Terrastruct servers when it's
next run after February 1. The new renewal date will be written to your local
authfile. The only data sent in this ping is the API token, and you can use
TALA completely offline before the expiration.

After 12 months of subscription, your copy of TALA is valid forever.

We do give a grace period of 30 days in case of payment issues where only a warning
is displayed. After the 30 days, the TALA plugin reverts to evaluation mode.

More information for each flag can be found at https://d2lang.com/tour/layouts/tala.

Flags:
--tala-seeds int64Slice random seed(s) to use for layout. Layouts will be run in parallel with the given seeds, with the best performing one returned. See the TALA manual for more. (default [1,2,3])
